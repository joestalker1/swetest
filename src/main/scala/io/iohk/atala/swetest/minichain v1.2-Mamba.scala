//
// We will be using this to have a technical discussion.
// A few focused hours should be enough but ultimately it is up to you.
// We definitely do not want you to spend many days of your personal
// time.
//
// Remember, this is a representation of your skill and ultimately the
// first point of contact with our technical recruitment team.
// If you think that something is worth doing - it's probably
// a good idea to show it off (eg. error handling, sensible unit test coverage, formatting).
//
// You can think about this code as virtual collaboration with a
// colleague.
//
// General requirements are:
//
//  - Your submission is an SBT project.
// 
//  - Your submission is a git repository with a commit log that you would submit as a PR.
//
//  - Ultimately it is up to the reviewer to understand the code submitted.
//    They do their best but if the code is hard to follow 
//    that will affect the evaluation.
//
//  - Review and complete the design and implementation.
//
//  - The coding language is Scala.
//
//  - You are free to come up with any solution you want but take into account
//    memory and time complexity.
//
//  - Comments stating "this could be done better with 'XYZ'" will be ignored.
//    We can speculate all day but at the end the code submitted is what is evaluated.
//
//  - If you come up with a solution for a piece of the code, 
//    but it is inefficient/doesn't capture all scenarios
//    and it would be very time consuming to implement a better one,
//    please add a comment describing the improvement, in what way it is better
//    and why you think it would be a lot of work.
//
//  - You must devise some tests to cover the code 
//    that would support its maintenance over time and in a team setting.
//    hint: this does not mean one test that shows one happy path engaging the whole application.
//
//  - Feel free to change any part of the design.
//
//  - The code is written in an OO imperative style. We strongly encourage an FP oriented solution.
//
//  - You are free to add any external libraries you need.
//
//  - You need to document the system requirements of the project (eg. major jvm version)
//    in a file called requirements.md.
//
//  - You must share your submission privately (i.e. not a public GitHub
//    repository). Typically, a zip archive with the local git repo project source code.
//
//  - Assume the code will run in a multi-threaded, multi-cpu environment.
//    You never know how concurrency (or is it parallelism?) will kick in.
//
//  - Whenever you are making changes to the supplied code base make a note with a reason/purpose 
//    (perhaps as part of the commit message).

// We build some ingredients of a mini blockchain. Concepts we will
// be dealing with are:
//
//   - Hash, which is the result of a cryptographic hash computation.
//     We use SHA-256.
//
//   - Transaction, which is the representation of data stored in the
//     "mini-chain". Currently, just a string message.
//
//   - Block, the fundamental building block, which we use to build
//     the chain, and holds many transactions.
//
//   - Blockchain, a singly-linked list of Blocks with some extra
//     API to build and query it.
//
//   - Proof-of-Work or PoW for short.
//     A computationally intensive algorithm whose role is to solve a
//     puzzle that allows the next block to appear in the blockchain.
//     We "mine" the next block by using PoW.
